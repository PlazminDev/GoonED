## How to play custom maps

- Press the Export button to export your map to a Fallen Aces map
- If you want to change the icon or loading screen just go in and swap the images with something else
- Drag THE WHOLE FOLDER into the Heart of Glass folder located in /Fallen Aces/AcesData/Episodes/ (You can also create your own episode by copying an existing one and renaming it)
- Start up Fallen Aces and select the episode you put your folder in and if you did everything correctly you should see your custom level showing up

## Help

- Saving maps saves it as a json file in the /saves/ directory. You cannot use these save files for Fallen Aces maps, you have to use the Export button which will export the map into a directory with the name of the map.
